## AWRAS: toward an ai that understand us

The primary goal of the AWRAS project is to develop a collection of language models specialized in comprehending and generating text in the **Algerian dialect**.

These models will be fine-tuned specifically for tasks such as complex, long-form **question answering** on local Algerian history and geography, with all generated responses exclusively in the Algerian dialect.

This initiative addresses the scarcity of resources for Algerian Arabic by adapting state-of-the-art base models.
